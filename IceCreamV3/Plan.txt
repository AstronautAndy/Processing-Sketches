Create two values: top and bottom
fill bottom and top with initial values- start 
possibleCombo value at 1.
increment the top by one until you have reached the 
"final value," counting the number of times you 
increment. Next, increment the bottom by one,
reset the top, and repeat

The process should look something like this: 
0-0
0-1
0-2 RESET
1-0
1-1
1-2 RESET
2-0
2-1
2-2
